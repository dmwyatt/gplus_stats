This NO LONGER WORKS.  Changes to the G+ website made it more difficult to parse the info we want out of profile pages,
and I'm not currently interested in figuring out Google's private API for this info.

Leaving up to remind me to look at it in the future.

Set up a cronjob to run profile.py every X minutes:
*/15 * * * * cd /home/dustin/gplus_followers; /home/dustin/env/bin/python /home/Dustin/gplus/profile.py

Generate a graph of followers:
python gen_graph.py profile.db graph.png

Requires:
matplotlib
Python 2.7
